Job Scout for Data Science is a tool designed to help users analyze their resumes and job descriptions, providing personalized advice using advanced machine learning techniques. This application leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning to deliver contextually accurate and useful responses. 

#### Features
- **Resume & Job Description Analysis**: Input job descriptions and upload resumes (text or PDF) for tailored advice.
- **Personalized Advice**: Combines document retrieval and language model generation to provide detailed, context-rich responses.
- **Contextual Replies**: Utilizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning.
- **Custom Queries**: Select from example questions or type custom queries related to resumes, job descriptions, or general career advice.
- **Knowledge Base**: Utilizes a curated database of data science interview prep materials and resources.
